I'm a first-year graduate student from  [School of SISE](https://sise.uestc.edu.cn/ ), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). My research interests include continual learning, AIGC detection, adversarial attacks, and machine learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qihe Liu](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37290887800) and [Prof. Fei Ye](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mWW1RxUAAAAJ&hl=en) from the Cybersecurity Laboratory, School of Information and Software Engineering, UESTC.
